# MotionScript: Natural Language Descriptions for Expressive 3D Human Motions



This is an official PyTorch implementation of _MotionScript: Natural Language Descriptions for Expressive 3D Human Motions_. In this paper, we introduce MotionScript, a novel framework for automatically generating detailed textual captions
of human motions. MotionScript descriptions differ from existing natural language representations in that it provides detailed descriptions in natural language rather than simple action labels or generalized captions.
